Variable
1. a variable is something you set to hold data types that you cna use or manipulate later.
2. ruby will put AbrahamLincoln as full name becasue it added two strings together in the order written

data types
string- a string is a section of letters and words.  Take as its own type. 
integer- what ruby sees as a number.  it can do math with them. 1,2,3,-6 ect
float- is an integer with a decmial 2.2
nil- nil is represted as nothing.  if you dont give an aswer or ski a qustion 		its nil
boolean is represeted as true or false.

algorithms
an algorithm is giving specific directions.  could be to a computer, program or 	person.  
 searching- looking through data for a specific outcome (checking emails with 		dogs in subject)
 sorting- sort data into catergories (sort words into alphabetical order)

 methods
 a method is a set of code the program does once called upon
 return value- what the outcome of a method is once complete
 side effect- if a method modifies some state or has an obserable interaction 		with calling funtions or outside world 
 parameter- the given rules or guidelines methods must follow.  
 argument- values that will be used if the callaer doesnt pass them explicitly.  
 implicit return- vlaue that is no specified but the last return value of method
 scope is where in a program a variable is accessible.  
 global- in the entire program marged with $
 method is a local veriable only avaible in that method

 control flow is how the program performs actions.  in what order, where to start and go next.
 loop- will run the same program over and over again until the stoping point is 	reached.   
 if one thing is true do this
 else- if the "if" is not reached run this
 elsif- addeding more parameters in the loop, becomig more specific
 while- while this is true do this, when it is not true stop
 until- do this until this is met.  Stop when the parameter is met.
