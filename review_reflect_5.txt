Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
It is a way to orgnaize information, in lists or in items and values.  It helps

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
an array is a list of items in ruby.  It has a name, brackets and different items inside.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
teams in the NBA, and making a grocery list

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
a hash is a way to organize data  taht has a key and value.  hases have a name use curly brackets.  it is different than an array because each item has two parts

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
list of items for sale (key) and how much they coast (value), an application form, type of information general (name) and specific to applicant (Craig)

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
executing a block of code on each item of an array or hash

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
if you are selling items, and an item is sold and out of stock, instead of listing a price (the value of a hash) it chamges to nil because you cant sell it anymore because you dont have it so no price is needed.

Blocks
8. What is a block?
a block is code you want to run but is limited to the parameters, not the entiere program.

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
it tells you what to run your code block on. the programer makes it up in the yeild statement.
