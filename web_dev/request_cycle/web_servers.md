Linux is open source so it is free so no cost using it.  

a VPS is a block of memory used as its own computer.  it has its own operating system.  It is used so it is always there and running.  only certian people have complete control so it can not be manipulated by outsiders.  It is nice becaus eit is on a sepreat computer or server that can be called by any computer
